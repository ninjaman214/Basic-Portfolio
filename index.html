                    <P>My life accomplishment is to help others using Biomedical Engineering. I became fascinated with the field of Biomedical Engineering (BME) whine watching a commercial program about the struggles of war damaged soldiers being re- introduced into society. Since then my vow has been to i, for the sake of the patriots that fight for this country and citizens of the world. <br> 
                    My experiences as a leader in various clubs and social activities will enable me to guide others in the creation of technology that will cure and stop many problems. My passion to help; I would like to leave a legacy that can be remembered and furthered exploited.  I would like to be able to increase the field of Biomedical Engineering to the state that patients would feel as if their lives can be the same. 
                   </P><p><br> I am an African American male born and raised in Liberia West Africa. My family struggle and longing for my success are my motivations; although my back ground is different from most people it has instilled in me the desire to become a role model to other males. Thee health rate and economical corruption are major factors in the downfall of its social economy, so I plan to show my gratitude to my family and love ones by strengthening its health bringing it one step closer to the great country I know it can be. My accomplishments further include establishing a prestigious and high class hospital in the country of Liberia, so that I may leave a landmark upon my homeland.  Through this legacy I will like to portray the ability of success for the sake of both African Americans and Liberians.</p><br>
                     <p>My dream is to become a prominent example of change and hope for the future generations. President Barrack Obama is one example of positive change and aspiration for the future generation, which is why he is valued in my eyes. Although president Obama’s path is different from mine I model him to gain the knowledge that he has acquired today. I do not view the president as successful due to his status in society, but true success lies in the struggles you endure and surmount. I have admires this philosophy knowledge comes in many sizes but with age comes wisdom. His is true due to the fact that I am the youngest in my classes, I may have the knowledge but it is often my peers that have the experience. President Obama’s many years of experiences that sought to this success is what molded him into a driven, leader, and that is  what I long to acquire someday in my later years. All these goals will ultimately help me develop into the confident self-motivated leader I know I can be.</P>
